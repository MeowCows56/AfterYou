## Description
AFTER YOU is a 3d first-person horro game focused on the experience of being chased. The player must keep moving forward to explore whilst avoiding being caught by the ghost, hiding, solving simple puzzles, and finding key objects in order to escape. 


### Main mechanics
*Collecting candles and talisman papers will help you progress through the game. These items can be used via pressing 'Tab' to access your inventory. Equipped candles have a limited duration, before it's lights out again for the player! When a candle is equipped, a talisman paper can be burnt to produce one of three effects (red will disable the enemy for a period of time, blue will increase the player's speed, green can save the game)
*There are many puzzles to be solved! In level one there is one, two in level two, and three in level three.
*You can run from the enemy by holding down 'shift'. If you are caught, you will die if you haven't found a checkpoint!
*Hiding places allow the player to hide with 'H'. The enemy will continue to roam the level, so wait until you think you are safe!
*Obstacles around the level will require you to jump ('space') or crouch ('ctrl') to navigate them
*'Censer's can be lit in order to store a checkpoint for the player to respawn at when they are killed. This allows puzzle progress to be saved. Special golden 'censers' placed in the level can be lit after completing all puzzles to continue to the next level.
